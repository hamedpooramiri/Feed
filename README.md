MVP:

The MVP pattern is similar to the MVC pattern. It is derived from the MVC pattern, wherein the controller is replaced by the presenter. This pattern divides an application into three major aspects: Model, View, and Presenter. The Model represents a set of classes that describe the business logic and data.
